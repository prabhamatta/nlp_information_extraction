NLP_InformationExtraction
=========================



Github link https://github.com/prabhamatta/nlp_information_extraction. Project files: Code in entity_recognition_time.py and testdata in labelled_data.txt to test precision and accuracy. 

entity_recognition_time.py contains the main writeup.

There are two files python files that attempt to solve the same problem, recognizing time-entities, but go about it in different ways:

entity_recognition_time.py 
and
time_entity_recognition_train.py

One uses a set of rules to find time entities, the other uses an IOB-format dataset.
time_entity_recognition_train.py requires that the file, train.txt, be in the same directory.
More details may be found in the files.
To test precision and accuracy, entity_recognition_time.py contains the functions which labelled_data.txt to test TIME entity recognition algorithm.
